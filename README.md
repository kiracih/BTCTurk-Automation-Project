# BTCTurk Automation Project

### Project consists of 3 main parts:

1. [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/ "What is Cucumber?") features: Test cases in terms of [BDD](http://toolsqa.com/cucumber/behavior-driven-development/ "What is BDD?").
2. Test Classes: Mapping from Cucumber features to java-selenium framework. This includes [TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/ "What is TestNG?") and Cucumber configuration.
3. Framework: All configurations and descriptions that enable testing (e.g. Driver, Page Objects, Actions, Assertions).
